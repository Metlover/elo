## Resubmission

This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Made the title more succinct.

* Elaborated the description of the package.

* Tweak the internal `elo.run` object.

## Test environments

* ubuntu 14.04 (on travis-ci): R 3.4.1, R devel, R 3.3.3

* win-builder (devel and release)

## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 1 note

* This is a new release.

## Reverse dependencies

This is a new release, so there are no reverse dependencies.
